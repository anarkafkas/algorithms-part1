# Solutions to Algorithms, Part I

These are my solutions to Algorithms, Part I, the Princeton course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. All solutions score 100% in correctness, timing and memory. More importantly, I have taken extra care to ensure the code is [clean](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and reads like [well-written prose](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-write-clean-code-d557d998bb08).

- prefer long descriptive names over comments
- smaller functions
- operating at the same abstraction level throughout a function (with trivial violations such as incrementing instance variables)

I have found that not only is this visually pleasing but it also helps me understand the algorithms much better.
